1. Introduction
1.1    Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define the complete functional and non-functional requirements of Kheyma, an end-to-end web platform designed to help users browse, compare, and reserve camping locations across Egypt. The system supports package selection, secure online payments, and administrative management tools for campsite owners and platform operators. This SRS describes the full system and outlines the complete scope, features, constraints, and interfaces required for its implementation.
1.2    Document Conventions
This document follows standard software engineering conventions for clarity and consistency:
	Terminology Capitalization: User, Registered User, Admin, and System are capitalized as defined roles.
	Requirement Identification Format: Functional requirements are numbered using the format (3.1-1), where the first two digits indicate the major feature and sub-category, and the last digit indicates the sequential requirement within that sub-category.
	Priority Levels: Requirements use High, Medium, and Low priority tags.
	Style and Structure: Headings follow the IEEE SRS organizational structure, ensuring consistency and readability across sections.
1.3    Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This SRS is intended for:
	Professors and Teaching Assistants evaluating the project.
	Developers and future maintainers implementing or upgrading the system.
	System designers and testers validating features and behaviors.
Readers should follow the document in its standard IEEE order from 1.1 to 4.4, beginning with the introduction, then the overall description, system features, and interface requirements.
1.4    Project Scope
Kheyma is a web-based camping reservation and package selection system that aims to:
	Make campsite booking easier by centralizing camping destinations across Egypt.
	Enable package comparison with clear pricing, feature breakdowns, and included amenities.
	Provide an Admin control panel for managing sites, packages, bookings, and user accounts.
The system includes secure payment processing, ticketless booking options for selected locations, and user profile management. Future recommendations may include a mobile application or integration into a larger tourism ecosystem.
